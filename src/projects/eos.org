#+description: Just another emacs configuration

* Introduction

  Just another org-mode based emacs configuration,
  or a elisp interpreter desktop distribution.

  Using emacs (elisp interpreter) as the only IO bridge between human
  and machine. In another words, a emacs configuration well design and
  integrated, that provides a generic computer environment
  for everyday use.

  We rely on org-mode to organize the whole configuration in a logic
  and manageable way, so the source code and its documentation are
  contained in only one file: ~init.org~
