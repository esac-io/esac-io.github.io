* Introduction

  Micro MIPS Simulator, it's a CPU simulator written in C
  with few dependencies as possible.
  Its purpose is to be fast and optimized.

  In the future a console will be integrated for quick access
  to required information (memory dump, registers values,
  instructions fields, program counter, etc).
