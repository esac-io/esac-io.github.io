* About

  Hello, Iâ€™m Isaac, a data oriented programmer,
  emacs student and open source enthusiast.

  In the header bar you can navigate to the pages: blog, contact,
  resume, projects and github repository.

  I will try to write blog posts about:
  mathematics, philosophy, algorithms, data oriented
  programming, emacs (elisp), low level technologies,
  signal processing, but occasionly, my personal views
  and some arbitrary thoughts.

  This website has been written in Emacs org-mode and nothing else,
  the source code it's available at [[https://github.com/esac-io/esac-io.github.io][repo]].
